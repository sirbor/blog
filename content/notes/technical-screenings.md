There’s so many problems with leetcodes, but mainly in that they are gameable
and usually not representative of the work you will be doing on the job. 

I would love something that is more ability to figure out a codebase and grok it
fast to fix a bug or use it. 

Can you with outdated docs, and a messy codebase figure out what is going on and
make it pass some test cases — can this be timeboxed? 

[Gossip Glomer’s](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) and [Praetorian Tech
Challenges](https://www.praetorian.com/challenges/) are awesome, but being a
requirement can be a hassle for high value candidate

As a talented candidate and there are two companies of equal pay, and I’m not
mission driven I’ll go for the less effort one. 

CTF’s are very interesting in the security space. DevOps interviews of trying to
set up a production system and manage a database. etc.

## Notes on Other's Opinions

### The Hiring Post

> https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/

Stand out quotes

- "The savviest teams will outcompete their peers by devising alternative hiring schemes."
- "here is the thing about interviews: they are incredibly hostile experiences for candidates."
- "Your first-call people need to be great at putting people at ease and selling the job."

The process they devised is as such:

1. Intro call to warm up candidates and tell them about the job to get them
   excited. Also ask a few questions to test their ability and knowledge of the
   field. If they don't know the field give them materials to get up to speed. 
   - A study guide with links/books/videos for them to use
2. Build work-sample tests.=
    - Don't have a 2 week trial test. Best candiates won't do it.
    - Their examples:
        - "we built an electronic trading system in a single-file Sinatra
        project. We made its interface a custom binary protocol. We built an
        extremely rudimentary web interface that drove the protocol. Then we had
        candidates find flaws in the trading system."
        - he same kind of process works for pure dev jobs. So, you’re a Rails
        shop? Take a Rails application you’ve actually built and deployed. Carve
        out some functional areas from the application: remove the search
        feature, or the customer order updater. Bundle up the app with all its
        assets, so that a single “vagrant up” gives a candidate an app that
        runs. Have them add back the feature you removed.

The key of the work sample should be to generate data. So with that in mind a
good rule is to NOT fast track elite candidates, because you want the data they
would generate from going through the test. 

Also we want to be as consistent and standardized as possible. Scripts for the
interview are ok so we can prevent inconsistencies between interviewer.
