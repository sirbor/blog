Recently, I was talking with my parents about some people from my early
child-hood and where they were now. My mom told me that someone was a Data
Scientist and said isn't that really impressive. When I heard that my first
instinct was no that's not impressive? But I had to stop myself because I heard
how that sounded and thought I was being a dick.

What I realized is how I view things as impressive or not. The reason I didn't
think being a Data Scientist was impressive was because I could visualize the
steps and work it takes to get there along with visualizing a lot of the job.
I've been working with many data scientists for a large part of my career and
had to do a lot of data scientist adjacent work at several roles. The work is
respectable and interesting. I know it takes hard work and I can give kudos for
that, but "impressive" wasn't the word that came to mind.

This is sorta similar to what I talekd about in [[A New Age of Magic]]. I find
things that I can't understand that are far beyond my comprehension. Just like a
regular magician, once I know the trick it stops being interesting. If you are a
creative working on researching and discovering new things I'd recommend you
read Frieren, there were ideas in there that I felt I related too a little too
hard.

This is a bit of a rant to verbalize a thought process I found myself having
without thinking. If you are working on something well known that takes hard
work I can find that respectable, but impressive is something I reserve for the
truly [Alien](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/suSpo6JQqikDYCskw/studying-the-alien-mind-1) ideas.
