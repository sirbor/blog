I've been thinking a lot about applications that make full utilization of their
potential. This has been relatively understood topic in the traditional web. 

Initially when we moved to the web people didn't really know how to build for
it, so they took analogies from what they already knew â€” documents. A lot of the
early web was basically just porting paper documents to a digital screen. This
led to the rise of word processing tools like Microsoft Word. 

Maggie Appleton discusses this in her [Metaphors We Web By](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web)
essay. Early on in my usage of computers this was pretty the same. Early
computer applications classes mainly just taught how to use little quirks of
word or excel and didn't venture much more. This was all fine, but it doesn't
really make full use of the potential of the medium. We were still thinking
skeumorphically. 

How often you do you come across a website that is interactive and fill with
animations, it's not just a vertical scroll, but has an infinite canvas.
Whenever I encounter these I'm always blown away. Text is an ok medium to
explain things, but when you're not limited to text why then only use it? 

One of my favorite examples of this are [explorables](https://explorabl.es/).
Small interactive experiences on the web that try to show not tell how different
concepts work. I'm not try to equate the difficulty in creating both. An
explorable is much more involved with art, interactive, a cohesive narrative,
but I'm saying I have not seen a lot of critical mass in the discussion of them.
I'll send explorables or other interactive works to friends and teachers and
they'll love them, but never mess with them again. 

I think the only place in my education where anything similar was used was in my
physics classes when we would use these [pHet Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/browse)

However, there are countless examples of these online. 

- This teardown of how a [mechanical watch works](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/)
- [3blue1brown's](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) match explanations that use animation to visualize concepts
- This nuclear [bomb simulator](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/)

It goes on. They're not all super easy to find as I kind of alluded to in
[[dark forest|the dark forest]].

## The Exceptions

The skeumorphic nature of the web started with how we present information but
also in the tools we use.
