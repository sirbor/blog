A collection of interesting projects for animation and shaders in the web. A lot
of these have to do with 3D graphics or potentially allow for full physics
systems. 


[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — Probably the most well known and popular 3D
WebGL based graphics library  

Some selected examples, links, and tutorials:

- [Building a Vaporwave scene with Three.js](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/vaporwave-3d-scene-with-threejs/)
- [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)

[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) — a lightweight Javascript animation library.
It looks very similar to greensock  
[Vanta.js](https://www.vantajs.com/) — A collection of plug and play animated
background  
[Isomer.js](https://jdan.github.io/isomer/) — An Isometric graphics library for
HTML5 canvas  
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) — A Javascript port of [processing](https://processing.org/)

Some selected examples, links, and tutorials:

- [L-Systems](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-l-systems.html)
- [Game of Life](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-game-of-life.html)

Processing always felt like it had feature parity to [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/) and there's a Javascript of
Löve2D as well.

[Shadeup](https://shadeup.dev/) — A language for writing shaders for WebGPU

There's also some interesting tools for making designs just through CSS

Some other aggregations and lists

- [CSS Doodle](https://css-doodle.com) — One of the simpler tools for creating
  doodles for css backgrounds.

The [Sparks Joy](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy) GitHub project has tons of
design tools and sources of inspiration
