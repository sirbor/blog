The idea that telling people an idea or plan that you have can release the same
dopamine that you would have gotten from just doing it. 

I'm particularly interested in this because of the giant backlog of projects I
have that keeps growing along with my [[dark forest|bookmarks]]. I want to be
public and talk about the things I'm working on, but I don't want to hack myself
into just getting the dopamine hits and never actually acting on my ideas.
