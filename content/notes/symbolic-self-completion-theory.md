The idea that telling people an idea or plan that you have can release the same
dopamine that you would have gotten from just doing it. 

I'm particularly interested in this because of the giant backlog of projects I
have that keeps growing along with my [[dark forest|bookmarks]]. I want to be
public and talk about the things I'm working on, but I don't want to hack myself
into just getting the dopamine hits and never actually acting on my ideas. 

A similar worry is that the [[colophon|seed, budding, evergreen]] pipeline for
notes and posts may suffer from the same core conceit. Writing a stub that
becomes a [[tags/seed|seed]] gives me enough satisfaction that I never graduate it to
[[tags/evergreen|evergreen]]. In some cases it may just be that other things are
more pressing or top of mind, but I can't help but worry about that. 

Even this note is a seed right now. I suppose we'll see if I'm able to expand on
my thoughts more
