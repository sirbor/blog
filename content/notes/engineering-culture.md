title: Notes on Engineering Culture

---

Been thinking a lot about how to organize an engineering team, run a team, and
build a good culture. Taking notes on different posts from blogs I follow. I'm
thinking about this from the lens of my early stage startup [Plastic
Labs](https://plasticlabs.ai/)

Some of these thoughts also influence my thoughts/notes on [[technical
screenings]]

---

The way I'm seeing this play out is as so:

1. Team / Company principles — These are ways and ideas I want to instill in the
   team and how I want us to act. More general ideas of how to be not
   necessarily concrete prescriptive actions or processes. More mental models
   and "vibes" of the team: "Don't be toxic", "bias for action", "customer
   obsession", "We're not perfect but we should strive to get better"
2. Expectations and standards for me — As a leader I want to set expectations
   for myself and want to be held accountable for them. So these are principles
   I want to say I will try to do and instill in future leaders in the
   organization. These should be specific vectors for feedback to grow with and
   things a member of the organization should be able to talk to me about if they
   feel a lapse. 
3. Operating Principles — More concrete prescriptive things. Might be some
   double dipping with #1. Thinking about it with things like: "bias for
   action", "don't waste excess time planning and with meetings" 

A whole separate note on managing "Hustle on Startups" is something I'm thinking
about too. I want to be very realistic there, but also talk about what I think
is healthy and what isn't. That's something I feel passionate enough about to
focus on.

### On Technical Deb: Shoveling Forward

> https://ferd.ca/on-technical-debt-shoveling-forward.html

My takeaway from this post which is more a reframing of technical debt is a
parallel to another post which talks about how to design our tech debt. Instead
of writing code that will accrue debt and be very hard to change, design code
that is easy to delete. Deleting can be faster than refactoring and often
better for moving forward. 

### You Are Not Your Impostor Syndrome

> https://flower.codes/2024/06/23/you-are-not-your-impostor-syndrome.html

Imposter syndrome is natural in the workplace and is often a good sign. This
post distills this pretty well and mentions some concepts that I'd hope are
present in team members. 

* Imposter syndrome is a sign you care
* It's a sign you're growing

I want our team to be a place where individuals are growing and often we are
going to be thrown into new territory either because we are scrappy or because
the job will morph as the company grows. 

Even if you don't initially have imposter syndrome I would encourage everyone to
be ambitious and seek discomfort.

### 15 Pieces of Advice That Will Make You a Better Leader

> https://flower.codes/2024/06/21/15-pieces-of-advice-that-will-make-you-a-better-leader.html

"At its core, it's about communication, honesty, and empathy."

My restatings and additional thoughts on the different ideas.

1. Communicate
2. We need to build trust so people can be comfortable and speak their mind
3. Humility is important and understanding we don't know everything. 
4. Ask questions ask questions ask questions. Personal thing for me a sign of a
   good leader is someone who can dig in and ask a ton of questions. Not really
   what this post is saying but it echos the importance of asking questions. 

> Note
> The idea that asking questions is a sign of a good leader comes from this talk
> I added a long time ago [influential questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xgiCK2msnM)

5. Listen then speak
6. Be strict about prioritizing. Actually do it don't give vague ideas.
7. Don't say "should" it's too vague and hard to dictate action on.
    * Nobody owns "should." It's safe. There's no accountability.
8. Take notes and write down everything. (I encourage PKM nerds to do their
   thing)
10. Classic be a leader not a manager idea. Lead by example.
11. Respect other's time. Super important especially when not all time is [[engineering-culture#the-37-signals| the same]]
12. Always be learning. If we want the ICs to do this it needs to start from the
    top.
13. Be able to log off and take time away.
14. Make sure metrics are meaningful. Be careful of [Goodhart's Law](https://coffeeandjunk.com/goodharts-campbells-law/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20a%20measure%20becomes%20a,to%20be%20a%20good%20measure.%E2%80%9D&text=All%20metrics%20of%20evaluation%20are,people%20start%20to%20game%20it.)
15. Actually care about people

### Authentically Speaking

> https://flower.codes/2024/01/16/authentically-speaking.html

"Real authenticity is about honest connection. It's about sharing a truth with
someone else—not to generate a specific outcome, but to create a relationship."

As a manager and a team we should strive for authenticity in our day to day
interactions. No use putting up fronts and no use lying about the state of
things. It'll just hurt us later.

### Work Life Imbalance

> https://flower.codes/2023/12/21/work-life-imbalance.html

- Immense overworking can come from a place of fear not only a "grindset"
- It's easy to get an unhealthy relationship with work where a lot of your self
  worth can be linked to your job performance.
- You should not have to feel guilty about doing things that keep you healthy or
  happy.
- "when you take responsibility for your teams' failures, yet pass all successes
  through to them, it can be pretty demoralizing, but that's the job of a good
  leader" — Being a leader is hard. 

### The Constant Introspection of Management

> https://www.elidedbranches.com/2013/12/2013-constant-introspection-of.html

Some notes on the difficulties of being a manager and the emotional challenges
you'll face along the way. 

"The hardest part for me of going from individual contributor/architect/tech
lead to managing in anger has been the lack of certainty."

- You need to care about your people without taking the things they do
personally. 
- Every person who quits feels like an indictment of all the ways you failed them.
- As a manager you lose both autonomy and mastery.
- You are always only as good as your team. 

### On the role of CTO

> https://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/02/cto.html

- The CTO is NOT an engineering role. 
- The CTO is NOT necessarily the best engineer in the company.
- There are many different paths to CTO and different focuses and approaches
- More on approaches:
    - Focus on processes of engineering
    - Focus on hiring/recruiting
    - Focus on technical architecture
    - Focus on product roadmap 

"The CTO is the technical leader the company has in its current stage of
evolution"

a better definition

"CTO should be the strategic technical executive the company needs in its current stage of evolution"
- "The CTO is an executive first, a technologist second."
- "the CTO must understand where the biggest technical opportunities and risks for
the business are and focus on capitalizing on them. "
- It is important to maintain reporting power and actual control of the team
otherwise it can be easy to lose your effectiveness.

### Notes on Startup Engineering Management for Young Bloods

> https://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/10/notes-on-startup-engineering-management.html

- Often leaders learn through mistakes, but those mistakes are often very
costly. 
- A startup is going to be different than a regular manager because you have no
  safety net.
- A big part of your job is to create that safety net.
    - Create sane processes
    - Create sane standards
- You need to setup the team to scale without you having to make every decision
  yourself.
- Coordination is hard!!
- If the set of projects going on can fit into your head, your project list is
probably trivial.
- If the set of people is small enough that everyone knows everyone else,
politics is trivial. Politics at that scale is a sign of organizational illness.
- "The team is moving too slow" is the hardest problem you'll ever debug.
- Trust is of the upmost importance as you get farther and farther from the
work. What you do for your direct reports will flow down the chain.
- Metrics are not everything but they can be useful.
- Learn to estimate capacity. 
- People can do more than they think they can. Especially at startups people
want to ship so let them. If you're bored do it better or cheaper. 
- People will quit. It's a reality you will have to learn to deal with. 
- Your job is to survive

### The Manager as Debugger

> https://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/11/the-manager-as-debugger.html

- The author often finds that people great at debugging are great managers. They
  are great at diving into and discovering the "why" around issues.
- You need to be able to hypothesis why problems are occurring, you can't rely
  stricting on micromanaging and monitoring as that can impact results

### Things Your Manager Might Not Know

> https://jvns.ca/blog/things-your-manager-might-not-know/

- What’s slowing the team down
    - Ask about their challenges
- Exactly what individual people on the team are working on
    - Ask what they are working on
- Where the technical debt is
    - Ask about technical risks
- How to help you get better at your job
    - Ask what they need to do better
- What your goals are
    - Ask about their goals
- What issues they should be escalating
    - Ask what they've been struggling with the most and as a follow up ask if
    it needs to be escalated
- What extra work you’re doing
    - What is extra work you are doing that isn't budgeted right now? Docs, etc.
      Can it be worked into the schedule? Can it be considered when thinking of
      career progression
- How compensation/promotions work at the company
    - I should know this lol

I largely think these are problems that will occur as the company grows bigger
at the small scale we are at right now, I should have visibility or direct
control over a lot of these. That being said still things that I can be
accountable for and might miss so will make efforts to not miss them.

### Getting Things Done

> https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/09/19/getting-things-done/

- Have a vision. Like this concept a lot should be clear what you are actually
working towards. If you don't get the vision work it out with the
manager/architect. Make a document. Do whatever you need to make it clear in
your head. 
- Focus on one thing at a time. Like this too. Don't overload and don't
multitask and do everything bad. Do one thing well and keep going. 
- Trying to get something every day. This is a good rule of thumb as well and
can be anything. Building on the [[engineering-culture#here's-how-to-live-create|
live to create]] idea can be notes, can be code, whatever. Put something out
there to crystalize your work.
- Talk to somewhen you get stuck — have a culture where it's ok to not know
everything, be humble and be comfortable asking for help.
- Do whatever's necessary — This with caveats. Make sure you are smart about
what you are doing. If you're going to create excess tech debt design to be
deleted, but ultimately find scrappy and subversive ways to get stuff done. 
- Believe in yourself — You were chosen to be on the team because we believe in
you, so believe in your ability to figure things out. 


### What's a senior engineer's job?

> https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/

A senior engineer, founding engineer, whatever you wanna call it, at a startup
especially one as small as Plastic is going to be expected to grow with the
organization and be incredibly high context. They will be a pillar as the
organization grows and there's a lot that will go into that. 

- Write code
- Do code reviews
- Write and review design docs
- Help team members when they're stuck
- Hold folks to a high quality standard
- Create new projects
- Plan your project's work 
- Proactively communicate project risks
- Communicate successes!
- Do side projects that benefit the team/company
- Be aware of how projects relate to business priorities — (be invested in the
direction of the company, don't do tasks mindlessly)
- Decide when to stop doing a project

There's a lot here but it's all about being a high agency thought leader that
can impact decision making and lubricate the development process to move faster.
You should be an augmentative force. 

What not to do:

- Make sure every team member’s work is recognized
- Make sure work is allocated in a fair way
- Make sure folks are working well together
- Build team cohesion
- Have 1:1s with everyone on the team
- Train new managers / help them understand what’s expected of them 
- Do project management for projects you’re not working on
- Be a product manager
- Do sprint management / organize everyone’s work into milestones / run weekly team meetings

Let your manager do their job and just work to support your team members.

### The 37 Signals

> https://37signals.com/

This company and the creator is referenced a lot online as a respected figure. I
hear these signals reflected a lot and their blog posts and ideas usually have
some merit, although they may not be relevant in every situation. That being
said I want to see which of the signals I like and which I find to be noise.

The ones I like:

- #3 Small Teams - You can do big things with small teams. I know they have a
concept of teams being no bigger than 2 people. I like this concept. Move's
fast, less useless meetings and standups, less communication drift. 
- #5 Err on the side of do — similar to bias for action. The idea that actions
are temporary and unless there's a large risk (huge credit spend, etc.) then
just go for it. If you're really worried document the decision so we can review
it later.
- #8 Work life balance — this is a hard one, startups in general will require
more from us since we're under resourced. But one key to pull out from this is
**A lac of sleep isn't a badge of honor, it's a mark of stupidity**. I wouldn't
go that far, but we shouldn't brag about burning ourselves out. 
- #11 Don't emulate the office — A crystalization of the idea "this meeting
could have been an email." It's real and should be remembered. 
- #12 Hours aren't equal — Some hours are better than others, uninterrupted
flow states vs broken up tiny chunks. I will do my best to guard engineers time
to give them the most high quality time possible. 
- #13 If you’re talking about something new or novel, you’ll have to repeat
yourself for years before you’re heard. — Something big at Plastic. We are
working on novel stuff it's going to take a while to get everyone caught up with
us. 
- #14 Meetings aren't free — a repeat a bit of #11, but understand that meetings
shouldn't be the default. Protect our time. 
- #15 Bury the hustle — Again a cultural thing I want to instill. Hustle culture
is toxic, but we need to work hard. Let's be honest about what's happening and
respect each other. 
- #25 Disagree and commit — We're going to have disagreements, but we need to
keep moving forward. It's better to find out we were wrong faster than spend
time debating longer. If we just try and realize it will pay off in the future
where we won't make it again. 
- #26 Kick in the face, kick in the ass — Let's be antifragile and grow from set
backs.
- #30 Miscommunication problems — As Osmo Wiio said, “If communication can fail,
it will. If a message can be understood in different ways, it will be understood
in just that way which does the most harm.” Take this to heart and do the work
to communicate clearly.
- #31 easy — be respectful of what other people are doing. Everything looks easy
when you're not doing it yourself
- #33 Planning is guessing — Keep plans shorter and understand they will change.
- #34 Sleep on it — a health thing and a good practice. I've found this very
often in my life, trusting my 12am self is rarely a good idea. 
- #35 Companies aren't families — My thought on this is there's two extremes and
  we want to sit somewhere in between. Sure we're not a family, but we should be
  friends, we shouldn't be enemies. Respect each other, help each other out. 
- #36 Context > Consistency — If something isn't working throw it out. That's
fine. 

Lot's of good stuff here. I generally see a lot of it as don't be toxic and be
respectful of other people and their circumstances. 

Don't waste peoples time with excess process and focus on "just doing things."

### Praetorian New Hire Survival Guide

> https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-New-Hire-Survival-Guide.pdf

Like the idea of a new hire survival guide in general. Very healthy practice and
evergreen note to keep building towards. A good exercise could be for new hires
to contribute to the new hire survival guide at the end of their first week. 

First week goals, similar to what I saw at Microsoft with the goal for first
commit or PR by the end of the week. 

Main focus in this is the culture page and the 11 principles. 

1. Default to open 
2. Orient to action
3. Lean into discomfort
4. Be Humble
5. Yes, and
6. Follow your passion
7. Put the customer first
8. Make craters
9. Performance matters
10. Try harder
11. Struggle and celebrate together

All bangers. Really nothing in here that I would push back or not want to
instill in my own organization. Open and clear communication, being a small team
that understands we don't know everything but we can figure it out and make
strides, putting the customer first and being obsessed, and remembering that it
is a team effort. 

### Work Life Harmony at Praetorian

> https://www.praetorian.com/blog/work-life-harmony-at-praetorian/

Key takeaway is that as a team we should be understanding of each other. A
startup makes it harder to have a distinct work life balance with a strict
schedule, but the advantage of being small is we can be flexible. 

Work the hours you need to, do what you need to to stay healthy and manage your
life, but let's get stuff done. 

None of us are trying to be asshole's and we should be here for each other.

### There's No Speed Limit

> https://sive.rs/kimo

Select quotes

- "If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects"

Really just a concept/idea I want to our team to have instilled. Don't get
caught up with arbitrary prequisites or credentials and be driven enough to
realize we can figure out and learn whatever we need. 

Have the agency and drive to do what you want and not get blocked by mental
blocks. Be ambitious and have a voracious appetite to grow and learn. 

### Here’s how to live: Create

> https://sive.rs/htl23

Love this idea here. We want creators not consumers. What matters is what you
can do and put out there. Whether that be ideas or products or whatever put it
out there. 

Bias towards action and putting stuff out. This will make it easier to
communicate your value from a career perspective and always keep the
company/team moving forward. Locking up ideas in your head forever makes it
harder for people to know what you are doing and can just cause confusion. 

Be transparent and act. Another quote I want to highlight here is: "Don’t wait for inspiration.
Inspiration will never make the first move." I've found this to be a huge unlock
in my career. You get ideas as you do stuff, you can't just wait. It's a similar
thing with startups. You shouldn't just think of an idea then make a startup, do
stuff and you'll see the problems that are worth solving. 

A thing to be careful of here is to not fall victim to [[symbolic-self-completion-theory|Symbolic Self Completion
Theory ]]

### Here’s how to live: Love

> https://sive.rs/htl22

My main takeaway here is have passion. Meet things where they are, love to
learn, love the craft, and be put yourself into your work.

### Stripe Operating Principles

> https://stripe.com/jobs/culture

Lot's of great ideas here and company principles to stick too. The first one
that always sticks out to me is **Customer Obsession**. Which they call **Users
first**.

The other principles are sorta no brainers to me. There's definitely a sense of
what should be implied and what should be directly stated. 

- Move fast and urgently, bias for action 
    - I think bias for action is the key takeaway here ⭐️
- Seek feedback is one that should be without saying but I want to focus on. The
  team should grow from each other. We want a team not a cluster of ICs. 

I like all of the "who are we". Highlights include:

- Resilient: This is important as a startup where every day is a rollercoaster
and you never know what works out to being the big thing that matters.
- Macro-optimistic: This is important because we need people who realize that
every problem can be figured out. They can't say I don't know and give up the
job is going to entail doing things we don't have expertise in. 
- Humble: Don't be a dick

For leaders

- Obsess over talent is an obvious one for me - it should be a privilege not a
right to work at a place. That's the type of culture and team we should strive
to create. 
- Being accountable — blame games are fruitless

Other slogans I love

* We haven't won yet 
    * Love this one a ton. Encapsulates a lot of ideas of urgency, the market
    and the relentlessness the company has. Especially at our stage but even
    moving forward we don't want to entshitify ourselves.
* Really, really, really care
    * You want a culture where caring helps and people are rewarded for it.
