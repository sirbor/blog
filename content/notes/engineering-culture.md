title: Notes on Engineering Culture

Been thinking a lot about how to organize an engineering team, run a team, and
build a good culture. Taking notes on different posts from blogs I follow. 

Some of these thoughts also influence my thoughts/notes on [[technical
screenings]]

---

The way I'm seeing this play out is as so:

1. Team / Company principles — These are ways and ideas I want to instill in the
   team and how I want us to act. More general ideas of how to be not
   necessarily concrete prescriptive actions or processes. More mental models
   and "vibes" of the team: "Don't be toxic", "bias for action", "customer
   obsession", "We're not perfect but we should strive to get better"
2. Expectations and standards for me — As a leader I want to set expectations
   for myself and want to be held accountable for them. So these are principles
   I want to say I will try to do and instill in future leaders in the
   organization. These should be specific vectors for feedback to grow with and
   things a member of the organization should be able to talk to me about if they
   feel a lapse. 
3. Operating Principles — More concrete prescriptive things. Might be some
   double dipping with #1. Thinking about it with things like: "bias for
   action", "don't waste excess time planning and with meetings" 

A whole separate note on managing "Hustle on Startups" is something I'm thinking
about too. I want to be very realistic there, but also talk about what I think
is healthy and what isn't. That's something I feel passionate enough about to
focus on.

### The 37 Signals

> https://37signals.com/

This company and the creator is referenced a lot online as a respected figure. I
hear these signals reflected a lot and their blog posts and ideas usually have
some merit, although they may not be relevant in every situation. That being
said I want to see which of the signals I like and which I find to be noise.

The ones I like:

- #3 Small Teams - You can do big things with small teams. I know they have a
concept of teams being no bigger than 2 people. I like this concept. Move's
fast, less useless meetings and standups, less communication drift. 
- #5 Err on the side of do — similar to bias for action. The idea that actions
are temporary and unless there's a large risk (huge credit spend, etc.) then
just go for it. If you're really worried document the decision so we can review
it later.
- #8 Work life balance — this is a hard one, startups in general will require
more from us since we're under resourced. But one key to pull out from this is
**A lac of sleep isn't a badge of honor, it's a mark of stupidity**. I wouldn't
go that far, but we shouldn't brag about burning ourselves out. 
- #11 Don't emulate the office — A crystalization of the idea "this meeting
could have been an email." It's real and should be remembered. 
- #12 Hours aren't equal — Some hours are better than others, uninterrupted
flow states vs broken up tiny chunks. I will do my best to guard engineers time
to give them the most high quality time possible. 
- #13 If you’re talking about something new or novel, you’ll have to repeat
yourself for years before you’re heard. — Something big at Plastic. We are
working on novel stuff it's going to take a while to get everyone caught up with
us. 
- #14 Meetings aren't free — a repeat a bit of #11, but understand that meetings
shouldn't be the default. Protect our time. 
- #15 Bury the hustle — Again a cultural thing I want to instill. Hustle culture
is toxic, but we need to work hard. Let's be honest about what's happening and
respect each other. 
- #25 Disagree and commit — We're going to have disagreements, but we need to
keep moving forward. It's better to find out we were wrong faster than spend
time debating longer. If we just try and realize it will pay off in the future
where we won't make it again. 
- #26 Kick in the face, kick in the ass — Let's be antifragile and grow from set
backs.
- #30 Miscommunication problems — As Osmo Wiio said, “If communication can fail,
it will. If a message can be understood in different ways, it will be understood
in just that way which does the most harm.” Take this to heart and do the work
to communicate clearly.
- #31 easy — be respectful of what other people are doing. Everything looks easy
when you're not doing it yourself
- #33 Planning is guessing — Keep plans shorter and understand they will change.
- #34 Sleep on it — a health thing and a good practice. I've found this very
often in my life, trusting my 12am self is rarely a good idea. 
- #35 Companies aren't families — My thought on this is there's two extremes and
  we want to sit somewhere in between. Sure we're not a family, but we should be
  friends, we shouldn't be enemies. Respect each other, help each other out. 
- #36 Context > Consistency — If something isn't working throw it out. That's
fine. 

Lot's of good stuff here. I generally see a lot of it as don't be toxic and be
respectful of other people and their circumstances. 

Don't waste peoples time with excess process and focus on "just doing things."

### Praetorian New Hire Survival Guide

> https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-New-Hire-Survival-Guide.pdf

Like the idea of a new hire survival guide in general. Very healthy practice and
evergreen note to keep building towards. A good exercise could be for new hires
to contribute to the new hire survival guide at the end of their first week. 

First week goals, similar to what I saw at Microsoft with the goal for first
commit or PR by the end of the week. 

Main focus in this is the culture page and the 11 principles. 

1. Default to open 
2. Orient to action
3. Lean into discomfort
4. Be Humble
5. Yes, and
6. Follow your passion
7. Put the customer first
8. Make craters
9. Performance matters
10. Try harder
11. Struggle and celebrate together

All bangers. Really nothing in here that I would push back or not want to
instill in my own organization. Open and clear communication, being a small team
that understands we don't know everything but we can figure it out and make
strides, putting the customer first and being obsessed, and remembering that it
is a team effort. 

### Work Life Harmony at Praetorian

> https://www.praetorian.com/blog/work-life-harmony-at-praetorian/

Key takeaway is that as a team we should be understanding of each other. A
startup makes it harder to have a distinct work life balance with a strict
schedule, but the advantage of being small is we can be flexible. 

Work the hours you need to, do what you need to to stay healthy and manage your
life, but let's get stuff done. 

None of us are trying to be asshole's and we should be here for each other.

### There's No Speed Limit

> https://sive.rs/kimo

Select quotes

- "If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects"

Really just a concept/idea I want to our team to have instilled. Don't get
caught up with arbitrary prequisites or credentials and be driven enough to
realize we can figure out and learn whatever we need. 

Have the agency and drive to do what you want and not get blocked by mental
blocks. Be ambitious and have a voracious appetite to grow and learn. 

### Here’s how to live: Create.

> https://sive.rs/htl23

Love this idea here. We want creators not consumers. What matters is what you
can do and put out there. Whether that be ideas or products or whatever put it
out there. 

Bias towards action and putting stuff out. This will make it easier to
communicate your value from a career perspective and always keep the
company/team moving forward. Locking up ideas in your head forever makes it
harder for people to know what you are doing and can just cause confusion. 

Be transparent and act. Another quote I want to highlight here is: "Don’t wait for inspiration.
Inspiration will never make the first move." I've found this to be a huge unlock
in my career. You get ideas as you do stuff, you can't just wait. It's a similar
thing with startups. You shouldn't just think of an idea then make a startup, do
stuff and you'll see the problems that are worth solving. 

### Here’s how to live: Love.

> https://sive.rs/htl22

My main takeaway here is have passion. Meet things where they are, love to
learn, love the craft, and be put yourself into your work.

### Stripe Operating Principles

> https://stripe.com/jobs/culture

Lot's of great ideas here and company principles to stick too. The first one
that always sticks out to me is **Customer Obsession**. Which they call **Users
first**.

The other principles are sorta no brainers to me. There's definitely a sense of
what should be implied and what should be directly stated. 

- Move fast and urgently, bias for action 
    - I think bias for action is the key takeaway here ⭐️
- Seek feedback is one that should be without saying but I want to focus on. The
  team should grow from each other. We want a team not a cluster of ICs. 

I like all of the "who are we". Highlights include:

- Resilient: This is important as a startup where every day is a rollercoaster
and you never know what works out to being the big thing that matters.
- Macro-optimistic: This is important because we need people who realize that
every problem can be figured out. They can't say I don't know and give up the
job is going to entail doing things we don't have expertise in. 
- Humble: Don't be a dick

For leaders

- Obsess over talent is an obvious one for me - it should be a privilege not a
right to work at a place. That's the type of culture and team we should strive
to create. 
- Being accountable — blame games are fruitless

Other slogans I love

* We haven't won yet 
    * Love this one a ton. Encapsulates a lot of ideas of urgency, the market
    and the relentlessness the company has. Especially at our stage but even
    moving forward we don't want to entshitify ourselves.
* Really, really, really care
    * You want a culture where caring helps and people are rewarded for it.
