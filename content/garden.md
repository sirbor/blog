## What Are AI Models?

AI models are computational frameworks designed to learn patterns from data and perform specific tasks. These models are trained on data, and once trained, they can make predictions, classify information, or even generate new content. AI models can be broadly categorized into the following types:

### 1. Supervised Learning Models
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data to predict outcomes. Some of the most commonly used models include:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values based on linear relationships between input features.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks, such as spam detection.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective for both classification and regression tasks, especially in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Tree-based models that are interpretable and powerful for classification and regression.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning Models
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, focusing on discovering hidden patterns or structures. Key models include:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into clusters based on similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving its structure.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Models
Reinforcement learning (RL) involves training agents to make decisions by rewarding desired behaviors. Key models include:

- **Q-Learning**: A model-free RL algorithm for learning optimal policies.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle complex tasks.
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Directly optimize policies using gradient ascent.

### 4. Deep Learning Models
Deep learning leverages neural networks to model complex patterns in data. Some of the most popular architectures include:

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: Basic neural networks used for classification and regression tasks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for image and video processing.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data like time series and text.
- **Transformers**: Revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) with models like GPT and BERT.
